## Introduction

### What is Time Complexity? (Simple Explanation)

Imagine you're organizing books in a library:
- **Time Complexity** answers: "How much longer does it take to organize books as the number of books increases?"

**Real-world analogy**: 
- If you have 10 books, it might take 1 minute to sort them
- If you have 100 books, how long will it take? 10 minutes? 100 minutes? 1000 minutes?
- Time complexity tells us this relationship

**In programming terms**:
- Time complexity measures how the **execution time** of your code changes when you give it **more data**
- It's like asking: "If I double my input, will my program take twice as long, or much longer?"

### What is Space Complexity? (Simple Explanation)

**Space Complexity** answers: "How much extra memory does my program need as the input gets bigger?"

**Real-world analogy**:
- If you're sorting papers on your desk, do you need:
  - Just your desk (constant space)?
  - A second desk for temporary storage (linear space)?
  - Multiple desks (quadratic space)?

**In programming terms**:
- Space complexity measures how much **extra memory** your algorithm uses
- It's like asking: "If I process 1000 items instead of 100, do I need 10x more memory?"

### Why Study Complexity? (Why This Matters)

**Think of it like choosing a car**:
- **Scalability**: Will this algorithm work when I have millions of users? (Like asking: "Will this car work for long road trips?")
- **Optimization**: Which algorithm is fastest for my specific problem? (Like asking: "Should I get a sports car or a truck?")
- **Resource Planning**: How much server power do I need? (Like asking: "How much gas will this car use?")

## Big O Notation (Simple Explanation)

### What is Big O? (Think of it like a speed limit sign)

**Big O is like a speed limit sign for algorithms**:
- It tells you the **maximum time** your algorithm will take
- It's like saying: "This algorithm will never be slower than this"

**Real-world analogy**:
- If you're driving to work, Big O tells you: "You'll never take longer than 1 hour, even in the worst traffic"
- It doesn't tell you the exact time (could be 20 minutes on a good day)
- But it guarantees you won't take more than 1 hour

### Why "Big O"? (The Name Explained)

**"Big O" means "Big Order of"**:
- It focuses on the **biggest, most important** part of the algorithm's performance
- Like saying: "The main thing that determines speed is..."

**Example**: If your algorithm does:
- 5 operations (constant)
- 100 × n operations (linear)  
- 2 × n² operations (quadratic)

Big O focuses on the **n²** part because that's what matters most when n gets big.

### Key Properties (Why We Simplify)

**1. Constants are ignored**: O(2n) = O(n)
- **Why?** Because 2n and n grow at the same rate
- **Real example**: Whether you walk 1 mile or 2 miles per hour, both are "walking speed"
- **In code**: `for i in range(n):` vs `for i in range(2*n):` - both are "linear"

**2. Lower order terms are dropped**: O(n² + n + 1) = O(n²)
- **Why?** Because n² grows much faster than n or 1
- **Real example**: If you're running a marathon, the 100-meter sprint at the end doesn't matter
- **In code**: The n² part dominates, so we ignore the smaller parts

**3. Focus on the dominant term**: O(n³ + n² + n) = O(n³)
- **Why?** Because n³ grows fastest
- **Real example**: In a race between a bicycle, car, and airplane, the airplane wins
- **In code**: The n³ part will be the bottleneck for large inputs

## Time Complexity Classes

### 1. O(1) - Constant Time
**Simple Explanation**: No matter how much data you have, it always takes the same amount of time.

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Looking up a word in a dictionary by page number
- Whether the dictionary has 1000 pages or 10,000 pages, if you know the page number, it takes the same time to flip to it

**Why it's O(1)**:
- The algorithm doesn't need to "search" through the data
- It goes directly to the right place
- Like having a GPS that takes you directly to your destination

**Examples**:
```python
# Array access
def get_first_element(arr):
    return arr[0]  # Always takes same time regardless of array size

# Dictionary lookup
def lookup_user(users, user_id):
    return users.get(user_id)  # Hash table lookup is O(1) average case

# Stack operations
def stack_peek(stack):
    return stack[-1] if stack else None
```

**Characteristics**:
- Most efficient
- Examples: array indexing, hash table lookup, stack/queue operations

### 2. O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time increases very slowly as data increases. Even with huge amounts of data, it stays fast.

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Guessing a number between 1 and 1000
- You ask: "Is it higher than 500?" → "No"
- "Is it higher than 250?" → "Yes"  
- "Is it higher than 375?" → "No"
- You can find any number in about 10 guesses, even if the range is 1 to 1,000,000!

**Why it's O(log n)**:
- Each step eliminates half of the remaining possibilities
- Like cutting a cake in half repeatedly
- Even with a huge cake, you only need a few cuts

**Examples**:
```python
# Binary Search
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Finding height of balanced binary tree
def tree_height(node):
    if not node:
        return 0
    return 1 + max(tree_height(node.left), tree_height(node.right))

# Binary tree search
def search_bst(root, target):
    if not root or root.val == target:
        return root
    if target < root.val:
        return search_bst(root.left, target)
    return search_bst(root.right, target)
```

**Characteristics**:
- Very efficient for large datasets
- Examples: binary search, balanced tree operations, some divide-and-conquer algorithms

### 3. O(n) - Linear Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time increases proportionally with data size. Double the data, double the time.

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Reading every page in a book
- If a book has 100 pages, it takes 100 minutes to read
- If a book has 200 pages, it takes 200 minutes to read
- The time is directly proportional to the number of pages

**Why it's O(n)**:
- You must look at each item once
- Like checking every house on a street to find someone
- No shortcuts - you have to visit each one

**Examples**:
```python
# Linear search
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i, val in enumerate(arr):
        if val == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Finding maximum element
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for val in arr[1:]:
        if val > max_val:
            max_val = val
    return max_val

# Sum of array elements
def array_sum(arr):
    total = 0
    for val in arr:
        total += val
    return total

# Traversing linked list
def traverse_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.val)
        current = current.next
```

**Characteristics**:
- Must examine each element once
- Examples: linear search, array traversal, linked list operations

### 4. O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time increases faster than linear but slower than quadratic. It's like doing a logarithmic operation for each item.

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Sorting a deck of cards using the "divide and conquer" method
- You split the deck in half, sort each half, then merge them
- For 52 cards, you do about 52 × log(52) ≈ 52 × 6 = 312 operations
- Much better than checking every pair (which would be 52² = 2,704 operations)

**Why it's O(n log n)**:
- You do n operations (one for each item)
- Each operation takes log n time (like binary search)
- So total time is n × log n

**Examples**:
```python
# Merge Sort
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

# Heap Sort
def heap_sort(arr):
    # Build max heap
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, len(arr), i)
    
    # Extract elements from heap
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[0], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[0]
        heapify(arr, i, 0)
    
    return arr

def heapify(arr, n, i):
    largest = i
    left = 2 * i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2
    
    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left
    
    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right
    
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, n, largest)
```

**Characteristics**:
- Efficient sorting algorithms
- Examples: merge sort, heap sort, quick sort (average case)

### 5. O(n²) - Quadratic Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time increases much faster than data size. Double the data, quadruple the time!

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Comparing every person in a room with every other person
- 10 people = 10 × 9 / 2 = 45 comparisons
- 20 people = 20 × 19 / 2 = 190 comparisons
- 100 people = 100 × 99 / 2 = 4,950 comparisons!
- The number of comparisons grows much faster than the number of people

**Why it's O(n²)**:
- You have nested loops: for each item, you check it against every other item
- Like a tournament where everyone plays everyone else
- The number of games grows quadratically with the number of players

**Examples**:
```python
# Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Selection Sort
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    return arr

# Finding all pairs
def find_all_pairs(arr):
    pairs = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            pairs.append((arr[i], arr[j]))
    return pairs

# Matrix multiplication (naive)
def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    rows_A, cols_A = len(A), len(A[0])
    rows_B, cols_B = len(B), len(B[0])
    
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Cannot multiply matrices")
    
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]
    
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    
    return result
```

**Characteristics**:
- Nested loops over the same data
- Examples: bubble sort, selection sort, naive matrix multiplication

### 6. O(n³) - Cubic Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time increases extremely fast. Triple nested loops - very slow for large data!

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Finding all possible combinations of 3 people from a group
- 10 people = 10 × 9 × 8 / (3 × 2 × 1) = 120 combinations
- 20 people = 20 × 19 × 18 / (3 × 2 × 1) = 1,140 combinations
- 100 people = 100 × 99 × 98 / (3 × 2 × 1) = 161,700 combinations!
- The number grows cubically (roughly n³)

**Why it's O(n³)**:
- You have three nested loops
- Like checking every combination of 3 items
- Very expensive - avoid if possible!

**Examples**:
```python
# Finding all triplets
def find_all_triplets(arr):
    triplets = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            for k in range(j + 1, len(arr)):
                triplets.append((arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]))
    return triplets

# Floyd-Warshall algorithm (simplified)
def floyd_warshall(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [row[:] for row in graph]  # Copy graph
    
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
    
    return dist
```

### 7. O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time doubles every time you add one more item. Gets impossibly slow very quickly!

**Real-world analogy**: 
- The "exponential growth" of a virus
- Day 1: 1 person infected
- Day 2: 2 people infected  
- Day 3: 4 people infected
- Day 4: 8 people infected
- Day 10: 1,024 people infected
- Day 20: Over 1 million people infected!

**Why it's O(2ⁿ)**:
- Each step creates 2 new possibilities
- Like a tree that branches into 2 at each level
- Very dangerous for large inputs - avoid at all costs!

**Examples**:
```python
# Fibonacci (naive recursive)
def fibonacci_naive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_naive(n - 1) + fibonacci_naive(n - 2)

# Power set generation
def power_set(arr):
    if not arr:
        return [[]]
    
    first = arr[0]
    rest = arr[1:]
    subsets = power_set(rest)
    
    return subsets + [[first] + subset for subset in subsets]

# Tower of Hanoi
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {destination}")
        return
    
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {destination}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source)
```

**Characteristics**:
- Very inefficient for large inputs
- Examples: naive recursive algorithms, brute force solutions

### 8. O(n!) - Factorial Time
**Simple Explanation**: Time grows factorially - even worse than exponential! Only works for tiny inputs.

**Real-world analogy**: 
- Arranging books on a shelf in every possible order
- 3 books = 3! = 6 arrangements
- 5 books = 5! = 120 arrangements
- 10 books = 10! = 3,628,800 arrangements
- 20 books = 20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 arrangements!

**Why it's O(n!)**:
- You're trying every possible arrangement
- Like a combination lock with n digits
- The number of possibilities grows factorially
- Practically unusable for anything larger than 10-15 items

**Examples**:
```python
# Permutations generation
def permutations(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return [arr]
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        first = arr[i]
        rest = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]
        for perm in permutations(rest):
            result.append([first] + perm)
    
    return result

# Traveling Salesman Problem (brute force)
def tsp_brute_force(distances):
    n = len(distances)
    cities = list(range(n))
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_path = None
    
    for perm in permutations(cities[1:]):  # Start from city 0
        path = [0] + perm + [0]  # Return to start
        cost = sum(distances[path[i]][path[i+1]] for i in range(len(path)-1))
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            best_path = path
    
    return best_path, min_cost
```

## Visual Comparison of Time Complexities

Let's see how different complexities perform with increasing data size:

| Input Size (n) | O(1) | O(log n) | O(n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(2ⁿ) | O(n!) |
|----------------|------|----------|------|------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1              | 1    | 1        | 1    | 1          | 1     | 2     | 1     |
| 10             | 1    | 3        | 10   | 33         | 100   | 1,024 | 3.6M  |
| 100            | 1    | 7        | 100  | 664        | 10K   | 1.3×10³⁰ | 9.3×10¹⁵⁷ |
| 1,000          | 1    | 10       | 1K   | 10K        | 1M    | Too big! | Too big! |

**Key Takeaway**: 
- O(1) and O(log n) stay fast even with huge data
- O(n) and O(n log n) are reasonable for most applications  
- O(n²) gets slow quickly
- O(2ⁿ) and O(n!) become unusable very fast

## Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the amount of memory used by an algorithm.

### Types of Space Complexity

#### 1. O(1) - Constant Space
```python
# In-place array reversal
def reverse_array(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return arr

# Finding maximum without extra space
def find_max_inplace(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for val in arr[1:]:
        if val > max_val:
            max_val = val
    return max_val
```

#### 2. O(n) - Linear Space
```python
# Creating a copy of array
def copy_array(arr):
    return arr[:]  # Creates new array of same size

# Merge sort (recursive calls)
def merge_sort_space(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort_space(arr[:mid])    # O(n/2) space
    right = merge_sort_space(arr[mid:])   # O(n/2) space
    
    return merge(left, right)  # O(n) space for result
```

#### 3. O(log n) - Logarithmic Space
```python
# Binary search (recursive)
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left=0, right=None):
    if right is None:
        right = len(arr) - 1
    
    if left > right:
        return -1
    
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)
```

#### 4. O(n²) - Quadratic Space
```python
# Creating adjacency matrix
def create_adjacency_matrix(edges, n):
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # O(n²) space
    for u, v in edges:
        matrix[u][v] = 1
        matrix[v][u] = 1
    return matrix

# Pascal's triangle
def pascal_triangle(n):
    triangle = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = [1] * (i + 1)
        for j in range(1, i):
            row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle
```

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Best, Average, and Worst Case Analysis

#### Quick Sort Example
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

# Best Case: O(n log n) - pivot always divides array in half
# Average Case: O(n log n) - pivot divides array reasonably well
# Worst Case: O(n²) - pivot is always smallest or largest element
```

### 2. Amortized Analysis

#### Dynamic Array (Python List)
```python
class DynamicArray:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capacity = 1
        self.size = 0
        self.data = [None] * self.capacity
    
    def append(self, item):
        if self.size >= self.capacity:
            self._resize()
        self.data[self.size] = item
        self.size += 1
    
    def _resize(self):
        self.capacity *= 2
        new_data = [None] * self.capacity
        for i in range(self.size):
            new_data[i] = self.data[i]
        self.data = new_data

# Individual append: O(1) average, O(n) worst case
# Amortized append: O(1) - expensive operations are rare
```

### 3. Space-Time Tradeoffs

#### Memoization Example
```python
# Without memoization - O(2ⁿ) time, O(n) space
def fibonacci_naive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_naive(n - 1) + fibonacci_naive(n - 2)

# With memoization - O(n) time, O(n) space
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]

# Iterative - O(n) time, O(1) space
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Analyze Time Complexity
```python
def mystery_function(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    return arr

# What is the time complexity?
# Answer: O(n²) - nested loops, but inner loop starts from i
```

### Problem 2: Optimize Space Usage
```python
# Current implementation
def find_duplicates(arr):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            duplicates.add(num)
        else:
            seen.add(num)
    return list(duplicates)

# Optimized version (if array contains only numbers 1 to n)
def find_duplicates_optimized(arr):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        index = abs(arr[i]) - 1
        if arr[index] < 0:
            duplicates.append(abs(arr[i]))
        else:
            arr[index] = -arr[index]
    return duplicates

# Space complexity: O(n) → O(1)
```

### Problem 3: Complex Algorithm Analysis
```python
def complex_algorithm(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    result = []
    
    # O(n²) - nested loops
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] > 0:
                # O(log n) - binary search
                result.append(binary_search(result, matrix[i][j]))
    
    # O(n² log n) - sorting
    result.sort()
    
    return result

# Overall complexity: O(n² log n)
```

## Summary

### Complexity Hierarchy (Best to Worst)
1. **O(1)** - Constant
2. **O(log n)** - Logarithmic
3. **O(n)** - Linear
4. **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic
5. **O(n²)** - Quadratic
6. **O(n³)** - Cubic
7. **O(2ⁿ)** - Exponential
8. **O(n!)** - Factorial

### Key Takeaways
- **Always consider both time and space complexity**
- **Big O describes worst-case performance**
- **Constants and lower-order terms are ignored**
- **Choose algorithms based on your data size and constraints**
- **Practice analyzing code to identify complexity patterns**

### Common Patterns
- **Single loop**: O(n)
- **Nested loops**: O(n²) or O(n × m)
- **Divide and conquer**: Often O(n log n)
- **Recursive with branching**: Often exponential
- **Hash table operations**: O(1) average case

### Interview Tips
1. **Always state your assumptions**
2. **Consider best, average, and worst cases**
3. **Discuss space-time tradeoffs**
4. **Think about optimizations**
5. **Practice explaining your analysis clearly**
